;     policy_type
;         prefix    policy applies to file/dirs matching prefix 
;             useful for things like SQLite databases with multiple files
;             can also use for directory prefixing
;         path      policy applies to file at direct path_component
;             use a slash at the end to indicate a directory prefix
;             using 'path', nested directories don't apply to the rule.
;             to apply nested directories also, use "prefix"
;         suffux    policy applies to file suffix path_component
;             can be used for extensions or folders in home directories
; 
;     path_component
;         the path component intended to match policy_type
;         must be encapsulates in quotes to accommodate spaces
;

;         use a slash at the end to indicate a path
;
